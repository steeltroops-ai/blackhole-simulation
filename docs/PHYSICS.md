# Relativistic Physics Specification

Technical foundations for the **Advanced Event Horizon Engine**. This document details the transition from geometric optics to radiative transfer and spectral rendering.

## 1. Metric and Spacetime Geometry

Computations utilize **Geometric Units ($G = c = 1$)**. The engine implements the **Kerr Metric** for a rotating uncharged black hole.

### 1.1 The Kerr Metric Tensor ($g_{\mu\nu}$)

We solve for the spacetime interval in **Boyer-Lindquist coordinates**:

$$
ds^2 = -\left(1 - \frac{2Mr}{\Sigma}\right) dt^2 - \frac{4Mar \sin^2\theta}{\Sigma} dt d\phi + \frac{\Sigma}{\Delta} dr^2 + \Sigma d\theta^2 + \left(r^2 + a^2 + \frac{2Ma^2r \sin^2\theta}{\Sigma}\right) \sin^2\theta d\phi^2
$$

Where:

- $\Sigma = r^2 + a^2 \cos^2\theta$
- $\Delta = r^2 - 2Mr + a^2$

### 1.2 Spacetime Embedding & Visualization

To present accurately curved geometry without resorting to "rubber-sheet" analogies, the Data Visualization engine utilizes exact physical transformations:

1. **True Volumetric Grids (Isotropic Radial Distortion)**:
   The radial proper distance scales dramatically towards the Event Horizon. To map the visual 3D lattice, we use a fixed observer frame and distort the interior matrix using the underlying tensor invariants. The inward scale is restricted strictly by $\Delta(r)$.

2. **Kretschmann Scalar Curvature**:
   Color mapping on the spacetime metrics traces $K$:
   $$ K = \frac{48M^2 (r^6 - 15r^4a^2\cos^2\theta + 15r^2a^4\cos^4\theta - a^6\cos^6\theta)}{\Sigma^6} $$
   Representing genuine coordinate-invariant physical tidal forces along the geodesics.

3. **River Model (Painlevé-Gullstrand) Light Cones**:
   Instead of plotting flat approximations, photon boundary limits are driven by the flow vector representation of spacetime moving at $v_r = -\sqrt{2Mr/(r^2+a^2)}$. The future cone boundaries physically tip radially inward to exactly $0^\circ$ at the horizon (nothing escapes).

4. **Frame Dragging Field**:
   A rotating (Kerr) black hole forces a Zero-Angular-Momentum-Observer (ZAMO) to co-rotate at angular velocity:
   $$ \omega = \frac{2Mar}{(r^2+a^2)^2 - a^2\Delta\sin^2\theta} $$
   Which we calculate across arbitrary polar angles (not just equatorial) to generate exact helical spatial flow visualization grids.

## 2. Advanced Path Integration

To achieve scientific precision, we move beyond simple ray-marching to **Symplectic Integration**.

### 2.1 Numerical Stability: Adaptive RKF45 (Cash-Karp)

Instead of a fixed-step Runge-Kutta method, we implement an **Adaptive Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg 4(5)** integrator in the Rust kernel:

- **Precision-Gated**: Uses an embedded 5th-order error estimate to adjust step size $h$ dynamically, maintaining local truncation error below a user-defined tolerance.
- **Horizon Stability**: Automatically shrinks the step size by orders of magnitude near the photon sphere to resolve extreme curvature without numerical breakdown.
- **Safety**: Integrated with a **Hamiltonian Regularizer** and **NaN Shielding** to prevent numerical singularities from poisoning the render pipeline.

### 2.2 Curvilinear Polar Sampling (Infinite Resolution)

Instead of sampling texture noise in Cartesian screen space $(x, y)$, we sample in curved spacetime coordinates $(r, \phi - \Omega t)$.

- **Feature**: This produces infinite resolution "streaks" that naturally follow the curvature of the accretion disk.
- **Zoom**: Allows for 1000x zoom levels without pixelation artifacts.

## 3. Radiative Transfer & Thermodynamics

We transition from **Geometric Optics** (tracing paths) to **Radiative Transfer** (tracing energy).

### 3.1 The Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE)

Instead of alpha-blending surfaces, we integrate the RTE through the volumetric accretion disk:

$$ \frac{dI*\nu}{d\lambda} = j*\nu - \alpha*\nu I*\nu $$

- **Emission ($j_\nu$)**: Energy generated by the plasma.
- **Absorption ($\alpha_\nu$)**: Energy blocked by the plasma (self-shadowing).
- **Exponential Transmittance (Phase 5.3)**: Uses $1 - e^{-\tau}$ integration to guarantee alpha values remain bounded in $[0, 1]$, preventing "white out" artifacts.

### 3.2 Spectral Radiance Transport (SPD)

To achieve PhD-level accuracy, we replace RGB color shifting with **Spectral Power Distribution (SPD)** transport.

1. **Representation**: Light is modeled not as RGB, but as coefficients of **Gaussian Basis Functions** spanning 380nm - 780nm.
2. **Relativistic Shift**:
   - Instead of shifting color $C' = C \cdot g$, we shift the entire spectral function $S'(\lambda) = S(\lambda / g)$.
   - This accurately models the "Searchlight Effect" where extreme blue-shift de-saturates colors into pure white intensity.
3. **Human Perception**: The final shifted spectrum is integrated against **LMS Cone Fundamentals** (Long, Medium, Short) to produce a physiologically accurate color response.

## 4. Accretion Dynamics (Time-Domain)

The black hole environment is dynamic, not static.

### 4.1 Hot Spots

We inject localized Gaussian blobs of hotter plasma at the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit ($r_{ISCO}$).

- **Dynamics**: Blobs orbit at the local Keplerian frequency $\Omega_K = \sqrt{M}/(r^{3/2} + a\sqrt{M})$.
- **Visual**: Allows visualization of differential rotation and frame dragging.

### 4.2 Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs)

The disk intensity is modulated by resonant frequencies derived from the metric eigenmodes, simulating the flickering observed in real black hole data.

---

## 5. Relativistic Polarimetry **[EXPERIMENTAL]**

Light acts as a vector wave. We solve the transport of the **Stokes Parameters** $(I, Q, U, V)$.

### 5.1 Gravitational Faraday Rotation

As light passes through the twisted spacetime (Frame Dragging), its polarization vector rotates.

- **Walker-Penrose Constant**: The kernel tracks the the complex scalar $\kappa_{WP}$ along the geodesic to maintain polarization consistency.
- **Visual**: Effectively visualizes the magnetic field lines of the black hole.

---

## 6. General Relativistic MHD **[EXPERIMENTAL]**

We simulate the **turbulence** of the plasma, not just its density.

- **Curl-Noise Advection**: A divergence-free velocity field $\vec{v} = \nabla \times \vec{\psi}$ is generated on the GPU.
- **Relativistic Shear**: The field is sheared by the Keplerian velocity $\Omega_K$.
- **Result**: Dynamic formation of vortices, filaments, and "magnetic" flux tubes.

---

## 7. Optical Phenomena

### 5.1 The Photon Ring ("Edge of Infinity")

The visualization resolves the **Photon Ring** ($r \approx 3M$ to $r \approx M$), where light orbits the black hole multiple times.

- **Variable Rate Shading**: We deploy maximum compute density to this region to resolve the fractal self-similarity of the shadow border.

### 5.2 Lensing & Einstein Rings

Background stars are not just textures; they are point sources deflected by the lens equation.

- **Deflection**: Calculated via elliptic integrals (in Rust) or high-precision ray-marching (WebGPU).
- **Amplification**: Brightness is boosted by the lensing magnification factor $\mu$.
